<h1 style="text-align:center;">One of historys Most Terrifying Legend's: The Windigo<h/h1>
<p1 style="text-align:center;"> According to the Algonguian traditions, a Windigo is a cannibalistic creature, that preys on the weak and socially disconnected. In many versions of this legend, a human often becomes a Windigo by scumming to greed or being exposed to hunger and cold. There are many different versions of the Windigo, often they are described as thin, with the skull and skeleton pushing through its ash-colored skin. Other stories describe the Windigo as a well-fleshed giant who gets larger the more it eats. One of the most well-known descriptions depicts it with animal-like ears with large antlers or horns on it’s head. The Windigo is known to posses supernatural powers, such as superhuman strength and stamina, allowing it to stalk, overpower, and devour its victims.</p1>

<p2 style="text-align:center;">The origin and history go back way beyond the arrival of Europeans in North America, it originates from the Algonquian-speaking First Nations in North America. Although the first written European account of a Windigo was by a man named Paul Le Jeune, he was a Jesuit missionary who lived among the Algonquin people in the early 17th century of what is now known as Quebec. In a report to his higher ups in Paris in 1636, Le Jeune wrote: “This devilish woman…. added that the Windigo had eaten some Attikamegoukin – these are the tribes that live north of the river that is called Three Rivers – and that he would eat a great many more of them if he were not called elsewhere. But that Atchen (sort of a werewolf) would come in his place to devour them… even up to the French fort; that he would slaughter the French themselves”. This report by Father Le Jeune exhibit’s the strong beliefs the 17th century Europeans had in supernatural spirits just like their First Nations contemporaries. Missionaries in this region had continued to make reports of the Windigo well into the 20th century.</p2>
<p3 style="text-align:center;">Windigo legends offer profound insights into the beliefs, societal structures, and traditions of the cultures that recount them. These tales serve as poignant reminders of the significance of community and the perilous consequences of exclusion. The narrative ingredients for a Windigo, namely extreme hunger, cold, and isolation, reflect the harsh realities faced by many First Nations people dwelling in the northern boreal forests. Frequently, Windigo stories commence with an individual or small group stranded in the wilderness, deprived of sustenance for prolonged periods, battling solitude and frigid temperatures. According to legend, Windigos preyed upon solitary travelers or members of groups, assuming their identities fleetingly before ultimately resorting to violence against any humans they encountered.</p3>
<p4 style="text-align:center;">Moreover, the legendary greed attributed to Windigos mirrors the prevailing attitudes towards sharing ingrained in various Indigenous cultures. Survival in the wilderness often hinged on communal cooperation and the equitable distribution of resources. Those who hoarded resources, particularly during times of scarcity, were vilified as "monsters" within their communities. Historian Shawn Smallman posits that the Windigo persists as a symbol of greed in contemporary society, emblematic of the unchecked pursuit of wealth and consumerism perpetuated by capitalism and corporate culture.</p4>
